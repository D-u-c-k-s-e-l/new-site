# The Tumblr Proposition

Proposition  
Pre-site

## What is Tumblr?

Tumblr is a site where you can post things, like 4chan, "formerly twitter", instagram, etc.
The difference is that tumblr has a healthier community because it's small.

## What's wrong with Tumblr?

Tumblr is a bad platform, is unprofitable, has been made worse over time, misrepresents itself,
some users hate the CEO, etc. Part of the Tumblr experience is the jank, but there's things that
can and should be improved.

## What can be done?

Here's the proposition:

1. A company is started. It asks all tumblr users to pay a small amount. That could be as low as
   \\($0.10\\), or as high as \\($10\\). In any case, this money is raised, and is used to buy tumblr.
2. Once tumblr is bought it is now run by the acquirers, who keep things running, while also making
   themselves the authority over the company.
3. Either contractually or (more likely) governmentally, the users now own tumblr and can vote on
   what happens to it.
4. Tumblr slowly improves.
